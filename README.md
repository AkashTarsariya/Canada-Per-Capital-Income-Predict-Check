# Canada-Per-Capital-Income-Predict-Check
This project predicts Canada’s Per Capita Income using Machine Learning (Linear Regression).
It includes data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and performance evaluation.
The goal is to build a simple and accurate model that helps understand income growth trends over time.
